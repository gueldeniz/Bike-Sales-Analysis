# Bike-Sales-Analysis

For my last student project in Career Foundry Data Analytics Course, I have chosen the Bike Sales data set. This is an external data source extracted from Kaggle. The data contains sales figures of bicycling products from Europe, USA, and Australia, between the years 2011 and 2016.

The data comprises of cost, revenue, profit, and unit price. Country and state information, gender of customers and age groups, as well as, product categories and sub categories are also to be found. Although it is not mentioned, the data probably belongs to a bicycle company that has stores in various countries, because the records include figures from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, UK and USA. With the dataset, the relationship between profit and age groups or gender can be observed. Additionally, profit percentage for each country, which products are sold the most in given years can be analysed.

I selected this data since I am a passionate daily cyclist and curios about the comparison of the bicycle sales in different countries of the world. For my student project, I wanted to select a dataset which corresponds to the requirement of the task as well as attracts my attention.

### Bicycle Sales Data contains:
 - 113036 rows, 18 columns
 - Contains 9 categorical variables: Date, Month, Age_Group, Customer_Gender, Country, State, Product_Category, Sub_Category, Product
 - Contain 9 continuous variables: Day, Year, Customer_Age, Order_Quantity, Unit_Cost, Unit_Price, Profit, Cost, Revenue
 - Includes geographical objects: 6 countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, UK, USA ) and their states
 - Includes time series: 2011 – 2016. (2016 year has values until July)

### Limitations and ethical considerations:
The bike sales data is sourced from website Kaggle. I selected the data because I am interested to find out how bicycles and related products are sold in big economies of the world. Although the data content is quite good, I don’t have enough information about the real source of the data, or about how it was collected. That is an important limitation of the data, on which I decided to work. However, dataset do not contain any PPI, so there is no privacy issues to attend to. Additionally, the fact that we do not know to which company makes this open source very safe to use without affecting the image or other private issues of the company. 

### Questions to explore:

1.	What is the most sold product category?
2.	Which countries brings more profit to the company?
3.	When is the best season for bicycle sales?
4.	Which age groups buy more?
5.	Do women or men buy more bicycle related products?
7.	Are there differences within countries in terms of ordering numbers?
8.	Do sales numbers change throughout the years? Why?
